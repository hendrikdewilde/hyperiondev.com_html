                    <p class="myItemsPSize myItemsPColor">The Xbox One S also comes with an all-new controller, again in the 'robot white' shade. The
                        controller will feature textured grips and includes Bluetooth in addition to proprietary
                        wireless capability, this resulting in a dramatically improved wireless range. The new
                        Bluetooth controller will also be compatible with PC and is included with the console, it's
                        also available to buy separately. Other changes include a front, easy-access, USB port.

                    <p class="myItemsPSize myItemsPColor">Powered by Frostbite, EA SPORTS FIFA 18 blurs the line between the virtual and real worlds,
                        bringing to life the players, teams, and atmospheres that immerse you in the emotion of The
                        World’s Game. The biggest step in gameplay innovation in franchise history, FIFA 18
                        introduces Real Player Motion Technology, an all-new animation system which unlocks a new
                        level of responsiveness, and player personality – now Cristiano Ronaldo and other top players
                        feel and move exactly like they do on the real pitch.
                    </p>
                    <p class="myItemsPSize myItemsPColor">Tour around the footballing world and visit incredible places such as Brazil, Los Angeles
                        and more. Each destination features new and improved graphics including high definition
                        dynamic crowds that will chant as you work into your attack and can be interacted with when
                        you score, authentic sun light and positions, debris on the pitch, adaptive commentary,
                        atmosphere grading and more. Sit down with other managers and discuss the transfer window
                        with interactive negotiations. The newest mapping technology provides each player with their
                        own unique identity, which combined with the updated dribbling tech adds more creativity and
                        excitement into the 1v1 battles. Locomotion and finishing animations have opened the option to
                        unlock more fluid heading and striking combinations, allowing for more dramatic goals and
                        saves than we’re used to. These new and exciting graphics provide the players with the
                        skillset required to go from a gentle tap of the ball, into a full sprint like Ronaldo,
                        giving you the most realistic gameplay that we have ever seen from FIFA.
